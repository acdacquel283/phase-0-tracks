# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version Control is a way of managing and tracking modification sto files over time, it is useful because it can help organize changes made by multiple users to one file. It is also very important in reverting back to previous version of a file and tracking specific changes and when they were made.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a pointer to each commit made, branches move out from the master branch. They are important in staging changes and merging.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? 
Commit will record changes to the repository. A good commit message is useful. It explains not only the change, but the context of a change. It explains why and how there was a change. It acts as a good collaboration tool.  
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when  2 branches are changing the same file, and then those branches need to be merged. Git will put up a message to help resolve these conflicts.
